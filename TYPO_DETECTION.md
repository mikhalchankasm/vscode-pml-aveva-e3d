# Typo Detection Feature ✨

**Added**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready

---

## 🎯 What It Does

Detects common typos in PML keywords and suggests corrections using **Levenshtein distance algorithm**.

### Examples:

| Typo | Suggestion |
|------|------------|
| `endiff` | Did you mean `endif`? |
| `endmethdo` | Did you mean `endmethod`? |
| `methdo` | Did you mean `method`? |
| `valeus` | Did you mean `values`? |
| `retrun` | Did you mean `return`? |
| `hendle` | Did you mean `handle`? |

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Compile
```bash
cd packages/pml-language-server && npm run compile && cd ../..
npm run compile
```

### Step 2: Launch Extension
Press **F5** to open Extension Development Host

### Step 3: Open Test File
Open `examples/test_typos.pml`

### Step 4: Check Warnings
You should see **yellow warnings** (⚠️) under:
- `endiff` (line 9)
- `endmethdo` (line 13)
- `valeus` (line 19)

**Hover** over the warning to see suggestion:
```
Unknown identifier 'endiff'. Did you mean 'endif'?
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Enable/Disable

In VSCode Settings (`Ctrl+,`):

```json
{
  "pml.diagnostics.typoDetection": "warning"  // or "off"
}
```

**Default**: `warning` (enabled)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Levenshtein Distance
Calculates "edit distance" between words:
- `endiff` vs `endif` = distance 1 (one extra `f`)
- `methdo` vs `method` = distance 2 (swap `o` and `d`)

### 2. Smart Detection
- Only suggests if distance ≤ 2
- Ignores strings and comments
- Doesn't flag variables (!var, !!global, .method)
- Only checks identifiers

### 3. Known Keywords
Checks against 60+ PML keywords:
- Control flow: `if`, `then`, `else`, `endif`, `do`, `enddo`, etc.
- Definitions: `define`, `method`, `endmethod`, `object`, etc.
- Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`, `eq`, `ne`, etc.
- Types: `STRING`, `REAL`, `ARRAY`, `DBREF`, etc.

## 📋 Supported Typos

### Common Mistakes:

```pml
-- Block endings
endiff   → endif
enddif   → endif
endfi    → endif
endmethdo → endmethod
endmehtod → endmethod
endobjet  → endobject

-- Keywords
methdo   → method
mehtod   → method
objet    → object
handl    → handle
hendle   → handle

-- Control flow
retrun   → return
contineu → continue
brake    → break (might be intentional!)
valeus   → values
indx     → index
```

---

## 🚫 Limitations

### False Positives
Some words might be flagged incorrectly:
- `brake` (mechanical part) vs `break` (keyword)
- Custom identifiers similar to keywords

### Workarounds:
1. **Disable for specific file**:
   Add comment at top:
   ```pml
   -- @pml-ignore-typos
   ```
   (Not implemented yet, but can be added)

2. **Disable globally**:
   ```json
   "pml.diagnostics.typoDetection": "off"
   ```

### What's NOT Detected:
- ❌ Logic errors (using wrong keyword)
- ❌ Typos in variable names (!vra vs !var)
- ❌ Typos in method names (.methdo vs .method)
- ❌ Typos in strings: `|endiff|` (correct - it's a string)

---

## 🎨 Severity

**Warning** (yellow ⚠️), not Error (red 🔴)

Why?
- It's a **suggestion**, not a syntax error
- Parser can still work with typos
- Allows flexibility for edge cases

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Possible additions:
- [ ] Custom dictionary (user-defined words to ignore)
- [ ] Learning mode (learn from your code)
- [ ] Quick fix: "Change to 'endif'" (auto-correct)
- [ ] Detection for method/variable typos
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions (block endings)

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Fast**: Runs in ~1-2ms for typical file
- **Non-blocking**: Runs after parsing
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled if needed

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test with `examples/test_typos.pml`:

- [ ] `endiff` → Warning "Did you mean 'endif'?"
- [ ] `endmethdo` → Warning "Did you mean 'endmethod'?"
- [ ] `valeus` → Warning "Did you mean 'values'?"
- [ ] No warnings on correct keywords
- [ ] No warnings in comments: `-- endiff is wrong`
- [ ] No warnings in strings: `|endiff|`
- [ ] Setting `"off"` disables warnings

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently. If you find one, report it!

## 📝 Code Location

- **Detector**: `packages/pml-language-server/src/diagnostics/typoDetector.ts`
- **Integration**: `packages/pml-language-server/src/server.ts` (line 224-228)
- **Config**: `package.json` → `pml.diagnostics.typoDetection`

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Algorithm: Levenshtein Distance

```typescript
function levenshteinDistance(a: string, b: string): number {
  // Dynamic programming
  // Time: O(n*m), Space: O(n*m)
}
```

### Threshold: Distance ≤ 2
- 1 char different: `endiff` → `endif`
- 2 chars different: `methdo` → `method`
- 3+ chars: ignored (probably not a typo)
