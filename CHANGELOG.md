# Changelog

All notable changes to the "PML for AVEVA E3D" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.5] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **MemberExpression AST Type** - Correct TypeScript typing
  - Changed `property` type from `Identifier` to `Expression`
  - Now supports computed (`arr[i+1]`) and non-computed (`.method`) access
  - Fixed TypeScript error: "Identifier not assignable to Expression"
  - `arr[0]` detection now actually runs (was always-false before)

- ‚úÖ **MemberExpression Range** - Correct highlighting
  - Fixed dot member access range (was pointing to line 0)
  - Now captures start position from object, not from file top
  - Go to definition and hovers now highlight correctly
  - Example: `!var.method` now highlights entire expression, not line 0

### Added
- Test file `test_array_zero.pml` with arr[0] edge cases
- Tests for elseif blocks with array access

## [0.5.4] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Parser MemberExpression** - Array index expressions now stored correctly
  - Before: `!arr[index]` stored fake Identifier('index')
  - After: Stores real parsed expression
  - Impact: Hovers, definitions, diagnostics now work on array indices
  - Fixed ranges - no more "pointing at top of file"

- ‚úÖ **ArrayIndexChecker** - Fixed crash on elseif statements
  - Fixed TypeError when `elseif` appears in code
  - Added proper handling for `ifStmt.alternate` (can be IfStatement or Statement[])
  - Updated `arr[0]` detection to check `Literal.value` instead of `property.name`
  - Now correctly detects and warns about zero-based array access

- ‚úÖ **Document Validation** - Diagnostics show immediately
  - Added validation on `onDidOpen()` - no need to edit first
  - Added validation on `onDidSave()` - revalidate after save
  - Before: diagnostics only appeared after first keystroke
  - After: red squiggles appear instantly when opening file

### Technical
- All fixes based on thorough code review
- Improved AST accuracy for member expressions
- Better error handling in analysis passes

## [0.5.3] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Typo Detector** - `!this` and common identifiers no longer trigger false warnings
  - Added whitelist: `this`, `ce`, `world`, `owner`, `name`, `type`, `result`, `error`, `value`, `data`, `item`, `list`, `count`, `index`
  - No more "Did you mean 'then'?" for `!this` in form context

### Reverted
- ‚ùå **Type Inference Engine (v0.6.0)** - Reverted due to complexity and instability
  - Type inference will be reimplemented properly in future version
  - Removed: `typeInferenceEngine.ts`, `builtInMethodsLoader.ts`
  - Reason: Parser API mismatch, not working in production

### Changed
