# Changelog

All notable changes to the "PML for AVEVA E3D" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **OF Operator Support** - Parser now supports `of` keyword as binary operator
  - Added OF token type and parsing logic
  - Works in expressions: `namn of zone`, `name of zone of $!element`
  - Supports chaining: `attr1 of attr2 of object`
  - Example: `:–û–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ OF $!element` now parses correctly

### Fixed
- **Auto-indentation for Functions** - Code formatting now works for function blocks
  - `define function...endfunction` blocks now auto-indent like methods
  - Added folding support for function definitions
  - Fixed indentation rules in language-configuration.json

- **Typo Detector Improvements** - Eliminated false positives on special characters

  - Skip attribute access (preceded by `:`)
  - No more warnings on underscores in Russian attribute names

### Improved

## [0.5.9] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Function Definition Support** - Parser now supports `define function...endfunction` syntax
  - New AST node: `FunctionDefinition` for .pmlfnc files
  - Parser accepts: `define function !!functionName(!param1, !param2)`
  - Properly closes with `endfunction`
  - Added FUNCTION and ENDFUNCTION token types
  - Example: `define function !!tsgreport()` now parses without errors

### Fixed
- **Typo Detector False Positives** - Reduced warnings on valid PML identifiers
  - Added to keywords: `function`, `endfunction`, `var`, `by`
  - Added to valid identifiers: `trace`, `off`, `on`, `of`, `file`, `zone`, `clock`, `namn`, `flnn`
  - Fixed: "var" no longer suggests "for"
  - Fixed: "trace" no longer suggests "frame"
  - Fixed: "off" no longer suggests "if"

## [0.5.8] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Sort Methods Command** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY ROADMAP ITEM
  - Command: `PML: Sort Methods (A‚ÜíZ)` - Sort methods alphabetically ascending
  - Command: `PML: Sort Methods (Z‚ÜíA)` - Sort methods alphabetically descending
  - Preserves preceding comments (JSDoc style and regular `--` comments)
  - Preserves blank lines between methods
  - Handles nested `define method` blocks correctly
  - Accessible via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
  - Example: Sorts `.zebra()`, `.apple()`, `.banana()` ‚Üí `.apple()`, `.banana()`, `.zebra()`

### Improved
- Method extraction algorithm in Sort Methods
  - Detects and preserves multi-line comments before methods
  - Handles empty lines gracefully
  - Case-insensitive sorting (natural order)

## [0.5.7] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Context-aware `!this.` Completion** - Form method IntelliSense
  - When typing `!this.` in a form file, shows only methods from current document
  - Supports both parsed methods (from AST) and regex-extracted methods
  - Example: `!this.` ‚Üí shows `.remove()`, `.init()`, `.report()`, etc.
  - Greatly improves developer experience when working with forms

### Fixed
- **Reduced completion spam on bare `.`**
  - Empty dot no longer shows unrelated completions
  - Only shows relevant methods when context is clear

### Improved
- **Better member completion logic**
  - Enhanced regex to match `!variable.` and `$variable.` patterns
  - Workspace methods now have better filtering and sorting
  - Method completions include parameter information

## [0.5.6] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: LSP Server Not Found in VSIX** - Fixed production deployment
  - LSP server compiled output now correctly included in VSIX package
  - Added explicit include patterns for `packages/pml-language-server/out/`
  - Updated compile script to build both extension and LSP server
  - Fixed path: `packages/pml-language-server/out/server.js` now packaged
  - Error resolved: "LSP server.js not found at: ...packages\pml-language-server\out\server.js"

- **Object Definition Parsing** - Full support for `define object` syntax
  - Parser now correctly handles `member .property is TYPE` declarations
  - Parser now correctly handles `define method` inside objects
  - Fixed "Expected 'method'" errors on `member` statements
  - Fixed "Expected expression" errors on `.data`, `this`, etc.

- **Backslash Escape Sequences** - Removed incorrect escape handling
  - PML does NOT use backslash for escaping (it's a literal character)
  - Fixed red highlighting on characters after `\` in strings
  - Windows paths like `|Z:\RSD81\SP4\PMLLIB\dop\file|` now parse correctly
  - Removed escape patterns from TextMate grammar

### Changed
- Disabled `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` in LSP server tsconfig
  - Prevents compilation errors from unused imports
  - Allows successful VSIX build process

## [0.5.5] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **MemberExpression AST Type** - Correct TypeScript typing
  - Changed `property` type from `Identifier` to `Expression`
  - Now supports computed (`arr[i+1]`) and non-computed (`.method`) access
  - Fixed TypeScript error: "Identifier not assignable to Expression"
  - `arr[0]` detection now actually runs (was always-false before)

- ‚úÖ **MemberExpression Range** - Correct highlighting
  - Fixed dot member access range (was pointing to line 0)
  - Now captures start position from object, not from file top
  - Go to definition and hovers now highlight correctly
  - Example: `!var.method` now highlights entire expression, not line 0

### Added
- Test file `test_array_zero.pml` with arr[0] edge cases
- Tests for elseif blocks with array access

## [0.5.4] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Parser MemberExpression** - Array index expressions now stored correctly
  - Before: `!arr[index]` stored fake Identifier('index')
  - After: Stores real parsed expression
  - Impact: Hovers, definitions, diagnostics now work on array indices
  - Fixed ranges - no more "pointing at top of file"

- ‚úÖ **ArrayIndexChecker** - Fixed crash on elseif statements
  - Fixed TypeError when `elseif` appears in code
  - Added proper handling for `ifStmt.alternate` (can be IfStatement or Statement[])
  - Updated `arr[0]` detection to check `Literal.value` instead of `property.name`
  - Now correctly detects and warns about zero-based array access

- ‚úÖ **Document Validation** - Diagnostics show immediately
  - Added validation on `onDidOpen()` - no need to edit first
  - Added validation on `onDidSave()` - revalidate after save
  - Before: diagnostics only appeared after first keystroke
  - After: red squiggles appear instantly when opening file

### Technical
- All fixes based on thorough code review
- Improved AST accuracy for member expressions
- Better error handling in analysis passes

## [0.5.3] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- ‚úÖ **Typo Detector** - `!this` and common identifiers no longer trigger false warnings
  - Added whitelist: `this`, `ce`, `world`, `owner`, `name`, `type`, `result`, `error`, `value`, `data`, `item`, `list`, `count`, `index`
  - No more "Did you mean 'then'?" for `!this` in form context

### Reverted
- ‚ùå **Type Inference Engine (v0.6.0)** - Reverted due to complexity and instability
  - Type inference will be reimplemented properly in future version
  - Removed: `typeInferenceEngine.ts`, `builtInMethodsLoader.ts`
  - Reason: Parser API mismatch, not working in production

### Changed
- üìö **Documentation Cleanup**
