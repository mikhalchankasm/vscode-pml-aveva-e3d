-- !another = test
```

**Features:**

### New Command: Align PML

Intelligently aligns code for better readability:

#### Align by `=` operator:

**Before:**
```pml
!lrtb = | anchor all |
!lrt = | anchor left + right + top |
!rt = | anchor right + top |
```

**After "Align PML":**
```pml
!lrtb     = | anchor all |
!lrt      = | anchor left + right + top |
!rt       = | anchor right + top |
```

#### Align by `is` keyword:

**Before:**
```pml
member .dfltsDir is string
member .wordFile is string
member .wordFileDir is string
```

**After "Align PML":**
```pml
member .dfltsDir    is string
member .wordFile    is string
member .wordFileDir is string
```

**Features:**
- Auto-detects alignment target (`=` or `is`)
- Works on selected lines
- Maintains proper spacing
