MemberExpression stores real index expressions\n2. ArrayIndexChecker handles elseif recursion\n3. Validation triggers on document open/save\n\nUpdated CHANGELOG.md and version to 0.5.4\")",
      "Bash(git commit -m \"fix: correct MemberExpression typing and ranges\n\nFixed critical issues from code review:\n\n1. **MemberExpression AST Type**\n   - Changed property type from Identifier to Expression\n   - Now supports both computed (arr[i+1]) and non-computed (.method) access\n   - TypeScript no longer reports ''Identifier not assignable to Expression''\n   - arr[0] detection now works correctly\n\n2. **MemberExpression Range**\n   - Fixed dot member access range (was pointing to line 0)\n   - Capture startPos from expr.range.start before loop\n   - Build proper range from object start to property/bracket end\n   - Go to definition, hovers now highlight correctly\n\n3. **Test Coverage**\n   - Added test_array_zero.pml with arr[0] cases\n   - Tests include: simple access, if conditions, elseif blocks\n\nAll fixes compile successfully and address LLM code review feedback.\")",

MemberExpression.property: Identifier → Expression\n2. Range calculation: capture startPos before loop\n3. Test coverage: test_array_zero.pml with edge cases\n\nUpdated CHANGELOG.md and version to 0.5.5\n\nAll critical issues from code review resolved!\")",

Did you mean ''for''?\"\"\n\n2. **Skip Method Calls**\n   - Method names after . are ignored (.Append, .size)\n   - Prevents false positives on object methods\n\n3. **Skip Directives**\n   - $P, $*, $$ directives are ignored\n   - No more warnings on PML output commands\n\n4. **Distance Threshold**\n   - Only flag words VERY similar to keywords (distance <= 2)\n   - Reduces noise from unrelated user identifiers\n   - Example: ''endiff'' (distance 1) flagged, but ''arr'' (distance >2 from ''for'') ignored\n\n5. **Better Messages**\n   - Changed \"\"Unknown identifier\"\" → \"\"Possible typo\"\"\n   - More accurate and less alarming\n\nResult: Typo detector now only catches actual typos like:\n- endiff → endif\n- methdo → method\n- whle → while\n\nUser variables and method calls are no longer flagged!\")"
