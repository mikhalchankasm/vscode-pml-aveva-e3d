Workspace root (for testing with local objects/)\n  2. Extension path (for bundled VSIX)\n  3. Fallback to relative path from __dirname\n\nTechnical Changes:\n- Updated: languageClient.ts - Pass extensionPath via initializationOptions\n- Updated: server.ts - Extract extensionPath from params.initializationOptions\n- Updated: BuiltInMethodsLoader - Smart path resolution with fs.existsSync\n- Updated: CompletionProvider - Accept extensionPath parameter\n\nNow objects/ folder will be bundled into VSIX and accessible to all users!\")",
