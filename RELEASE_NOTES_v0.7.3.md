# v0.7.3 - Typo Detection Overhaul

## üéØ Major Fix: Eliminated False Positive Warnings

This release completely eliminates annoying false positive warnings like:
- ‚ùå ~~"Possible typo: 'OK'. Did you mean 'or'?"~~
- ‚ùå ~~"Possible typo: 'at'. Did you mean 'gt'?"~~

### What Changed?

**Before (v0.7.2):**
The typo detector scanned every word in the file using regex, causing warnings on:
- UI labels in forms (`button .OK`, `text at 10 20`)
- Arbitrary identifiers
- Variable names
- Any word similar to a PML keyword

**After (v0.7.3):**
- ‚úÖ **AST-based checking** - Only examines keywords in specific language structures
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware** - Knows the difference between keywords and identifiers
- ‚úÖ **Form-friendly** - Disabled for `.pmlfrm` files entirely
- ‚úÖ **Faster** - Reuses already-parsed AST instead of re-scanning text

## Fixed

### Typo Detection Overhaul
- Completely rewrote typo detector to use AST-based checking
- No more warnings on arbitrary identifiers like `OK`, `at`, `on`, etc.
- Only checks keywords in specific language structures (methods, if statements, etc.)
- Arbitrary identifiers (UI labels, variable names) are no longer flagged
- Disabled typo detection for `.pmlfrm` files (form syntax is special)

### Performance Improvements
- Parser now reuses already-built AST instead of re-parsing text
- Validation is faster due to AST reuse
- Reduced diagnostic overhead

### Form File Handling
- Better handling of `.pmlfrm` files with reduced noise
- No more false warnings on form gadgets and properties

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `packages/pml-language-server/src/diagnostics/typoDetector.ts`
  - Added AST parameter to `detectTypos()` function
  - Added `walkAST()` function to traverse specific node types
  - Removed text-based regex scanning (source of false positives)

- `packages/pml-language-server/src/server.ts`
  - Updated to pass parsed AST to typo detector
  - Added check to disable typo detection for `.pmlfrm` files

### How It Works Now

1. **Parser builds AST** from source code
2. **AST is cached** and reused for all diagnostics
3. **Typo detector walks AST** looking only at specific node types:
   - `MethodDefinition`
   - `FunctionDefinition`
   - `ObjectDefinition`
   - `IfStatement`
   - `DoStatement`
   - `HandleStatement`
   - etc.
4. **Everything else is ignored** - no more false positives!

## Installation

Download `pml-aveva-e3d-0.7.3.vsix` and install:

```bash
code --install-extension pml-aveva-e3d-0.7.3.vsix --force
```

Or install from Extensions view: Extensions ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Install from VSIX

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes
- Existing PML code continues to work
- You'll immediately notice fewer/no typo warnings
- Form files (`.pmlfrm`) now have cleaner diagnostics
